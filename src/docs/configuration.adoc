[[configuration]]
== Configuration

The plugin provide a default configuration, but you may add your own settings in your *Config.groovy* for Grails 2.x and *application.groovy* or *application.yml* for Grails 3.x.

=== Overriding Spring Boot elasticsearch version

Spring Boot 1.3.x supports Elasticsearch 1.5.2 OOTB (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-dependencies/pom.xml#L76) and will install dependencies for this version, if not explicitly overriden. To do so add the following to your `build.gradle`:

[source, groovy]
----
def elasticsearchVersion = '2.3.3'
ext['elasticsearch.version'] = elasticsearchVersion
----

=== Client mode

You can set the plugin in 3 different modes, detailed on the http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/current/[official ElasticSearch doc].
The mode is defined with the following config key:

[source, groovy]
.applicaiton.groovy or Config.groovy
----
elasticSearch.client.mode = '<mode>'
----

[source, yml]
.application.yml
----
elasticSearch:
	client:
		mode: <mode>
----

.Possible values for client node
[width="100%",cols="2",options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description

|node
|The plugin create its own node and join the ElasticSearch cluster as a client node (`node.client = true`). This setting requires that you have an ElasticSearch instance running and available on your network (use the discovery feature)

|dataNode
|The plugin create its own node and join the ElasticSearch cluster as a node that can hold data. This setting requires that you have an ElasticSearch instance running and available on your network (use the discovery feature)


|local
|The plugin create its own local (to the JVM) node. Does not require any running ElasticSearch instance. Useful for development or testing.

|transport
|The plugin create a transport client that will connect to a remote ElasticSearch instance without joining the cluster.
|===


"Transport" mode needs you to provide the host address and port. You can define one or multiple hosts with the following config key:

[source,groovy]
.application.groovy or Config.groovy
----
elasticSearch.client.hosts = [
       [host:'192.168.0.3', port:9300],
       [host:'228.168.0.4', port:9300]
]
----

[source, yaml]
.application.yml
----
elasticSearch:
	client:
		hosts:
    	- {host: 192.168.0.3, port: 9300}
		- {host: 228.168.0.4, port: 9300}
----

If no host is defined, `localhost:9300` will be used by the transport client.

==== Using node or dataNode during development

If you configure your dev environment to use `node` or `dataNode` you might see the following exception:

[source, groovy]
----
'elasticSearchClient': FactoryBean threw exception on object creation; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: path.home is not configured
----

In order to make this work you need to define `es.path.home` in VM options.

[source, groovy]
.Grails 2.x
----
grails run-app -Des.path.home=<PATH_TO_ELASTICSEARCH_HOME_DIR>
----

[source, groovy]
.Grails 3.x (build.gradle)
----
bootRun {
    jvmArgs = ['-Des.path.home=<PATH_TO_ELASTICSEARCH_HOME_DIR>']
}
----


=== Mapping Migration properties

Define the application's behaviour when a conflict is found while installing Elasticsearch mappings on startup. For a detailed explanation, see <<Mapping Migrations>>.

==== `elasticSearch.migration.strategy`

Defines the behaviour to follow if an error occurs on startup when the application is installing new mappings on ElasticSearch due to conflicting mappings.

.Possible Values for migration strategy
[width="100%",cols="2",options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description

| `'none'`
|No changes on the indices or mappings will happen, the merge problem will be logged and a MappingException will be thrown.

| `'delete'`
|The conflicting mapping will be deleted (along with all indexed content of that type) and replaced with a new mapping. Deleted content can be automatically reindexed on startup by using this in combination the `elasticSearch.bulkIndexOnStartup` config option

| `'alias'`
|Applies http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/changing-mapping-with-zero-downtime/[Elasticsearch recommended approach for migrating conflicting mappings]. A new numbered index will be created (`<indexName>_vX`) where new mappings will installed for all the types included on the original index. An Elasticsearch alias called `<indexName>` will point to the new index. As content won't be available on the new index, content can be automatically reindexed on startup by using this in combination the `elasticSearch.bulkIndexOnStartup` config option. It is recommended to set `elasticSearch.aliasReplacesIndex` to deal with potential index/alias conflicts.

|===

[NOTE]
====
The default is `'alias'`.
====

==== `elasticSearch.migration.aliasReplacesIndex`

Deals with a special conflict case using the `'alias'` strategy. When the `'alias'` migration strategy is chosen and there's a mapping conflict on an index, defines whether to replace the index with a versioned index (`<indexName>_vX`) and an alias (`<indexName>`). This is required when applying the alias strategy on top of existing indices for the first time as indices cannot be renamed (from `<indexName>` to `<indexName>_vX`) and an alias cannot exist with the same name as an index.
	
.Possible Values for aliasReplacesIndex
[width="100%",cols="2",options="header"]
|===
|Value| Description

| `true`
| The index and it's content will be deleted and a versioned index and an alias will be created. Deleted content can be automatically reindexed on startup by using this in combination the `elasticSearch.bulkIndexOnStartup` config option

| `false`
| Falls back to the `'none'` strategy. Event will be logged and a MappingException will be thrown.

|===	

[NOTE]
====
The default is `true`.
====

==== `elasticSearch.migration.disableAliasChange`

In some cases the developer may prefer not to upgrade the alias to the new version of the index until some other tasks are performed. This allows them to disable automatically pointing the alias to a new version of the index when this is created. Aliases can be changed later on manually or programatically using `elasticSearchAdminService`

.Possible Values for disableAliasChange
[width="100%",cols="2",options="header"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `false` 
| Standard behaviour

| `true`
| Prevents the aliases to be changed to point to a new index
|===

[NOTE]
====
The default is `false`.
====

=== Dynamic Method Injection

==== `elasticSearch.searchMethodName`

Change the name of search method in domain class. By default it's `search`. 

For example

[source, groovy]
----
MyDomain.search("${params.query}")

----

[TIP]
====
In order to change the method name to `esSearch` just update the `elasticSearch.searchMethodName='esSearch'` in application.groovy
====


==== `elasticSearch.countHitsMethodName`

Change the name of countHits method in domain class. By default it's `countHits`. 

For example

[source, groovy]
----
MyDomain.countHits("${params.query}")

----

[TIP]
====
In order to change the method name to `esCountHits` just update the `elasticSearch.countHitsMethodName='esCountHits'` in application.groovy
====



==== `elasticSearch.disableDynamicMethodsInjection`

To complete disabled injection of dynamic methods set `elasticSearch.disableDynamicMethodsInjection = true` in `applicaiton.groovy` 


=== Others properties

==== `elasticSearch.datastoreImpl`

Only required when enabling the auto-index feature.
This property specifies which GORM datastore implementation should be watched for storage events.
The value should be the name of the datastore bean as it is configured in the Spring context; some possible values:

.Possible Values for datastoreImpl
[width="100%",cols="2",options="header"]
|===
| Value | Description

| mongoDatastore
| The name of the MongoDB datastore bean.

| hibernateDatastore
| The name of the Hibernate datastore bean.

|===


==== `elasticSearch.bootstrap.config.file`

When using then plugin to construct a local node, the default Elasticsearch configuration is used by default.
If you use a modified Elasticsearch configuration, you can use this property to specify the location of the file (as an application resource).

==== `elasticSearch.bootstrap.transportSettings.file`

When choosing transport mode this configuration will be used to set up the TransportClient settings (used by some cloud providers).

==== `elasticSearch.client.transport.sniff`

Only usable in with a transport client.
Allows to sniff the rest of the cluster, and add those into its list of machines to use.
In this case, the ip addresses used will be the ones that the other nodes were started with (the “publish” address)

==== `elasticSearch.cluster.name`

The name of the cluster for the client to join.

==== `elasticSearch.date.formats`

List of date formats used by the JSON unmarshaller to parse any date field properly.
Note : future version of the plugin may change how formats are manipulated.

==== `elasticSearch.defaultExcludedProperties`

List of domain class properties to automatically ignore (will not be indexed) if their name match one of those.
This will apply to both the default-mapped domain class, with the static `searchable` property set to "true", and when using closure mapping.
To override this setting on a specific class, it can be added to the `only` property of the `searchable` closure.

==== `elasticSearch.disableAutoIndex`

A boolean determining if the plugin should reflect any database save/update/delete automatically on the indices.
Default to `false`.

==== `elasticSearch.bulkIndexOnStartup`

Determines whether the application should launch a bulk index operation upon startup.

.Possible Values for bulkIndexOnStartup
[width="100%",cols="2",options="header"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `false`
| No indexing will happen on startup.

| `true`
| All content will be indexed on startup.

| `'deleted'`
| This value is related to the mapping migration strategy chosen. If any migration is required and any content is deleted due to it, on startup only indices and mappings lost will be indexed. More on <<Mapping Migrations>>.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Default to `true`.
====

==== `elasticSearch.index.name`
A string indicating which ElasticSearch index should be used.  If not present, will default to the package name of the domain in question.

==== `elasticSearch.index.compound_format`

Should the compound file format be used (boolean setting).
Set to `false` by default (really applicable for file system based index storage).
More details on this setting on the http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-modules/[ElasticSearch Documentation].

==== `elasticSearch.index.store.type`

Determine how the indices will be stored.
More details on the possible values on the http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-modules/store.html[ElasticSearch Documentation].

.Possible value for index store type
[width="100%",cols="2",options="header"]
|===
| Value | Description

| memory 
| Stores the index in memory. Useful for testing. *Please note* that it's not support in ES 2.0 and later versions.

| mmapfs
| Stores the shard index on the file system (maps to Lucene MMapDirectory) using mmap.

| niofs
| Stores the shard index on the file system (maps to Lucene NIOFSDirectory) and allows for multiple threads to read from the same file concurrently.

| simplefs
| Stores using a plain forward implementation of file system storage (maps to Lucene SimpleFsDirectory) using random access file.

|===

==== `elasticSearch.index.numberOfReplicas`

Sets the number of replicas created for each shard of the index. If not present, will default to zero.

==== `elasticSearch.gateway.type`

Determine the gateway type to be used.
More details on the possible values are in the http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/modules/gateway/[ElasticSearch Documentation].
Using a setting of "none" (possibly in combination with index.store.type set to "memory") can be useful for tests.

==== `elasticSearch.maxBulkRequest`

Max number of requests to process at once.
Reduce this value if you have memory issue when indexing a big amount of data at once.
If this setting is not specified, 500 will be use by default.

==== `elasticSearch.path.data`

The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated on the node.

==== `elasticSearch.path.plugins`

The location of plugin files such as native scripts. Each plugin will be contained in a subdirectory.

==== `elasticSearch.searchableProperty.name`

The name of the ElasticSearch mapping configuration property that annotates domain classes. The default is 'searchable'.

==== `elasticSearch.includeTransients`

Whether to index and search all non excluded transient properties. All explicitly included transients in `only` will be indexed regardless.

[NOTE]
====
Default is `false`.
====
