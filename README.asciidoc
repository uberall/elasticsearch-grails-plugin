== Elasticsearch Grails plugin

An Elasticsearch plugin for Grails; This project is a fork based on the great work done by the guys at https://github.com/mstein/elasticsearch-grails-plugin.

=== Why would you want to fork the original Elasticsearch plugin?

The original Elasticsearch plugin relies on *Hibernate-specific* GORM components, thus rendering it unusable if you back your Grails application by any other database.

=== How can I obtain the plugin?

image:https://travis-ci.org/noamt/elasticsearch-grails-plugin.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/noamt/elasticsearch-grails-plugin"]

Just like any other Grails plugin, through the Grails Plugin center.
Edit your project's +build.gradle+ file, by adding the plugin's dependency declaration:

----
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "org.grails.plugins:elasticsearch:1.2.0"
    ...

}
----


=== Versioning

|===
|Plugin Version | Grails Version | Elasticsearch Version

|1.2.0
|3.1.y
|2.3.z

|1.0.0.x
|3.1.y
|1.6.z

|0.1.0.x
|2.y
|2.1.z

|0.0.4.x
|2.y
|1.6.z

=== Ohs Nos! I'm hitting a +java.lang.Exception: No datastore implementation specified+

This error means that you probably haven't specified your datastore type in your +application.groovy+ or +application.yml+ file.
This plugin has an auto-index feature which automatically propagates any changes made to searchable Domains into the search index;
this is done by hooking into GORM's storage events but also requires a reference to the active datastore implementation.
To fix, edit your project's +application.groovy+ or +application.yml+ file and add:
application.groovy
----
elasticSearch {
    ...
    datastoreImpl = 'nameOfDatastoreBean'
    ...
}
----

application.yml
----
elasticSearch:
    datastoreImpl: nameOfDatastoreBean
----
Where the value should be the name of the datastore bean as it is configured in the Spring context; some possible values:

MongoDB::
    +mongoDatastore+
Hibernate::
    +hibernateDatastore+
